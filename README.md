# Reservation Display Page

A simple Phoenix app that makes use of channels to keep the page updated with changes in reservations made in
Supersaas.com. I made this for my local makerspace [Gizmo-CDA](www.gizmo-cda.org) to help with their in-demand equipment
and to teach myself Elixir and Phoenix.

This page is displayed in the Laser Cutter room so all members and users can see who is on the schedule.

I host it on google app engine.
